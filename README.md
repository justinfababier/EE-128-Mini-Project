# EE 128: Sensing and Actuation for Embedded Systems - Mini Project
Welcome to my CS 120B custom laboratory project repository for the course "Introduction to Embedded Systems" at UC Riverside. This repository contains the code, documentation, and resources for my project.

## Project Description

This project simulates digital door lock behavior. Core components include a 4-by-4 membrane keypad, a passive buzzer, and a 2-phase bipolar stepper motor.
