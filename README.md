# EE 128: Sensing and Actuation for Embedded Systems - Mini Project
Welcome to my EE 128 custom laboratory project repository for the course "Sensing and Actuation for Embedded Systems" at UC Riverside. This repository contains the code, documentation, and resources for my project.

## Project Description

This project simulates digital door lock behavior. Core components include a 4-by-4 membrane keypad, a passive buzzer, and a 2-phase bipolar stepper motor.
